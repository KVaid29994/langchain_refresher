    "In LangChain, the models component is a foundational part of the framework. It acts as the interface between LangChain and various language models, including large language models (LLMs), chat models, and text embedding models. This component provides the abstraction needed to use models from different providers (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, HuggingFace) in a unified and consistent way."
